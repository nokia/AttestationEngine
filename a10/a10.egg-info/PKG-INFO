Description: # A10 Libraries
        
        These libraries provide the core functionality for the Nokia Attestation Engine.
        
        The instructions here are to be used while developing and testing. To run in a production/sane environment use docker-compose.
        
        ## Build and Install Locally
        Run the commands below together as follows. There's also a command included to remove pyc files and the pycache folder just in case because these have a nasty habit of hanging around and causing really odd bugs such as missing attributes and modules even though the files are really there! 
        
        ```bash
        find . | grep -E "(__pycache__|\.pyc|\.pyo$)" | xargs rm -rf
        sudo pip3 uninstall a10
        sudo python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        sudo python3 setup.py install
        ```
        
        
        ## Upload to Artifactory
        
        Edit `~/.pypirc' as follows:
        
        ```
        [distutils]
        index-servers = local
        [local]
        repository: https://artifactory-espoo2.int.net.nokia.com/artifactory/api/pypi/nbl-nae-pypi-local
        username: ioliver
        password: (see artifactor SETUP page for the hashed password)
        ```
        
        Then
        
        ```bash
        sudo -E python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload -r local
        ```
        
        
        ## Documentation
        
        Generated using sphinx
        
        To generate the API documents:
        
        ```bash
        cd doc
        sphinx-apidoc -f -o source/ ../a10/
        make html
        ```
        
        NB: this leaves stuff around which sphinx-build picks up on, eg: old files etc. Will have to find out how to properly clean this directory. Using `make clean` didn't seem to help.
        
        ### Some Sphinx stuff for reference
        For reference the conf.py file contains the lines
        
        ```python
        import os
        import sys
        # sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))
        sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../../a10'))
        print("SPHINX PATH=",sys.path)
        ```
        
        This worked on Sphinx 1.8.5 .. the `needs_sphinx` entry should be updated to reflect this.
        
        The extensions required are:
        
        ```python
        extensions = [
            'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
            'sphinx.ext.todo',
        ]
        ```
        
        If the RTD theme is used:
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install sphinx-rtd-theme
        ```
        
        The entry in the conf.py is
        
        ```
        html_theme = "sphinx_rtd_theme"
        ```
